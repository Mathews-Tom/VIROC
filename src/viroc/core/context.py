"""Build context and artifacts shared across the compiler and adapters.

A :class:`BuildContext` is the read-only environment threaded through a compile:
where the project lives, where outputs go, project config, and renderer config
(design §5 adapter contract). A :class:`BuildArtifact` is a content-addressed
output — generated source, a rendered video, captions, a manifest — pairing the
payload (in memory and/or on disk) with its ``sha256:`` digest.

These are pure data carriers; construction helpers that compute the digest live
as module functions (:func:`artifact_from_bytes`, :func:`artifact_from_text`,
:func:`artifact_from_path`) so the dataclasses stay behavior-free.
